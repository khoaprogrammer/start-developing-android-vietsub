Hello, this is Chiu-Ki Chan, and welcome to the Android Studio Installation module.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In this module, you are going to learn how to setup Android Studio, the IDE, or Integrated Development

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Environment for Android. First, we will check that you have the proper JDK installed on your computer.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Next, we will download and install Android Studio. Finally, we will import the Hello World project and run

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
it on an emulator, and then a device.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Android Studio requires JDK version 7. To make sure that is installed on your computer, open the Terminal app.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you are on Windows, you can use the command prompt. In the terminal, type java -version.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Look at the build number. The number after 1. is the JDK version.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In this example we have a 6, which means that we need to download the latest JDK.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Go to the JDK 7 download page. Scroll down to look for the one matching your operating system.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Accept the license agreement and download. Once the download completes, open the file to install it.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Then go back to the terminal. Type java -version to verify that you have JDK 7.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Once again, the number behind 1. is the JDK version. Here you can see that we have JDK 7 installed.
