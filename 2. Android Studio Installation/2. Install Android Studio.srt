00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's download Android Studio. Go to developer.android.com/sdk, and click on the Download button.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Accept the terms and conditions and download. Once the download completes, open the file to install it.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Then open Android Studio. Choose the Standard setup. Android Studio will download the SDK and libraries.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This will take a while, so make sure you set aside a lot of time.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
When that is all downloaded, you will see the Welcome to Android Studio screen.

00:01:07,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Now we are ready to import the Hello World app.
