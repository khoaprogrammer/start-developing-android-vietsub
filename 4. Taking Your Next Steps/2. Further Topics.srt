00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I hope that this course has given you a good foundation to continue to learn about Android.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is just the beginning. There is a lot more to learn in Android.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here are a few areas that you may want to explore next: Navigation, UI, compatibility, background,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
persistence, and testing.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Navigation is the way that we move from one part of the Android app to another.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In our Hello World example, we only have one activity, so we didn't really need to go anywhere.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Most apps will have more than one activity, and that will be your next step, to learn how to coordinate

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
between the different activities and how to move from one to the other using intents.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Next, you may want to learn about UI. In Hello World we used TextView.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There are many other different widgets that you may want to use.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you want to put multiple of them on screen, you would like to use a layout such as linear layout,

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
relative layout, and frame layout. Another way to put multiple things on screen is to use ListView or RecyclerView.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Fragments are kind of like mini activities, and it is used in many different parts of Android.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Compatibility refers to the fact that there are many different kinds of Android devices out there,

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and you will need to figure out how to support them. For example, there may be phones, which are a little

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
bit smaller than tablets, or some devices are denser than the others.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You have already gotten a taste of that in Hello World when we were defining different dimensions and different styles.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Another big topic is background. Everything you have written in your MainActivity right now runs on the UI thread.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This thread corresponds to user actions, and you do not want to make it busy by having long-running functions

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
such as going off to the internet to fetch some data. Instead, you should run that in a background thread.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Persistence means that you want to store some data so that it is saved even when the user shuts down the

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
phone and then turns it back on. The first tool in your persistence toolbox is SharedPreferences.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Last, but not least, testing. You have had a little taste of Espresso testing in Hello World.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
To write robust apps, you will want to learn how to write tests alongside your app.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Unit testing and Espresso are the two major ways.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The world of Android changes very quickly, so it's a little bit of a futile exercise if I list the resources

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you can use to learn about all these topics. I have collected them in the ReadMe file of the Hello World

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:03,000
repository at github.com/chiuki/Android-hello-world. Go there and click on the various classes to learn more.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Happy coding.
