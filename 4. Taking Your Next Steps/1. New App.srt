00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Congratulations! You have imported the Hello World app and added many functionalities to it.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You have added drawables, dimens, style, menu, and test. Now it's time for you to write your own app.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let me show you how to create an app in Android Studio. Go to File, click New, New Project.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Here you are choosing the application name and the package name.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to call my app Awesome. I own the domain sqisland.com, so I put that in my Company Domain.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Android will pick a package name for me automatically. The project location is where you want to store this

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
project on disk. Choose a location that you can find later. Next, we need to decide a minimum SDK.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This will affect how many devices can run your app. Click on Help me choose to get a better idea.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is the percentage of devices that you'll be able to target it you select the corresponding level.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As of November 2015, API level 16 Jelly Bean is a good choice. Next, we will add an activity to our app.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Choose the Blank Activity. Finally, give a name to your activity.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
MainActivity is fine. You can leave the rest of the parameters as the default.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
First, go to the left tab and select Project view. This reflects the directory structure as on disk,

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and it's a little bit easier to understand. Next, expand the app, and take a look at what is generated.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This should be pretty familiar to you by now. Just like Hello World, we have a MainActivity, and in the res

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
folder we see the various mipmap directories for the launcher icon.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you go into values, you will see that we have strings and also dimens.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We have covered that in the Hello World app. With the Hello World app, you have a really good foundation to

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
go ahead and write your own awesome app.
