00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
An Android project has a lot of files and folders. Many of them specify the structure and dependencies for

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the build to assemble and compile the app. We will not go into them right now.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The code for your Android app lives in the app folder. If you dive into the source folder, you can see that

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
there is a file called AndroidManifest.xml. This defines the overall structure of your Android app.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Take a look at the application tag. Inside it has an attribute called android:label.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
At this moment you can see that it says Hello world, but if you click on it, you can see that the actual

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:59,000
value of android:label is @string/app_name. The reason why we saw Hello World earlier is because Android

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Studio, by default, performs code folding for you, meaning that it's going to replace some of the variables

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
with these values so that you can read it more easily. Inside application, we have a tag called activity.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
As I explained in the introduction module, an Android application consists of multiple screens or activities.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For the Hello World app, we have one activity called MainActivity.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Again, activity has a label. This label defines what is displayed on the title bar.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Inside the activity tag we see an intent-filter. It has the action MAIN and category LAUNCHER.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This tells Android our MainActivity is the one that we want to show in the launcher.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What is the launcher? The launcher is how Android shows apps that are installed on the device.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You can see that our app is listed under Hello World. That is the application label.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
One way we can navigate inside Android Studio is using Command+click.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
For instance, if we want to know where is string app name defined, we can do a Command+click on it.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This will move us directly into the strings.xml file. If we want to locate this file within our folders,

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:36,000
go and click on this target icon. Here we can see that strings.xml goes under app/src/main/res/values.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is where the variable app name is defined. Let's go back to the manifest and take a look at MainActivity.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In MainActivity we have the onCreate function. Android calls this when the activity is created.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Inside onCreate we call the function setContentView. This tells Android what to display.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We give it R.layout/activity_main. Let's take a look at this file.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is a graphical representation of the layout that Android's going to show.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you want to look at the code, click on the Text tab. Here we can see that it's an XML file.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The root tag is a TextView. TextView is used to display text. What text?

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Look into the attribute android:text. Again, code folding shows us that it says Hello world.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If we click on it, we can see that the string/hello_world is defined once again in the strings.xml file.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Strings.xml allows us to put all the string in a central location for easy translation.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This allows us to provide other values for these strings for different languages.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In summary, you need four files to make a basic Android app. AndroidManifest.xml specifies the structure of your app.

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Inside you will have a MainActivity, the main screen of your app.

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
In order to tell Android what to show in MainActivity, we have a layout of XML file.

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Through our app, whenever we need to show text, we put them in strings.xml file.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This allows easy translation. Now that we understand the basic structure of an Android project,

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
let's make it more interesting by adding a launcher icon.
