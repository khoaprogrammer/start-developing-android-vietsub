00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
When you think of a desktop application, you probably think of it as a single unit.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You open the app and do various things in it. On Android, it is slightly different.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Rather than a single unit,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it is better to think of an Android app as a collection of screens, or activity as they are called in Android.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
An activity is very similar to a web page. We can think of a

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
website as a collection of web pages,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and an Android app as a collection of activities. Let's go through an example.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Here we are looking at the main page of the Twitter website. The equivalent in Android will be MainActivity.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
On the Twitter main page, we can click on an avatar to see the user profile.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
On Android, we can do the same. What happens in that click? On the web, you are sent to a different page as

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
specified by the URL. On Android, you are sent to a different activity as specified by an intent.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
On the web, links are not restricted to a single website; same for Android.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In fact, Android intents are more powerful than web links because the receiving activity can send data back

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
to the original activity.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
For instance, when we click on the photo icon on the Twitter app, we are sent to the Gallery app.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We pick a photo in the Gallery app, which is then sent back to the Twitter app to be attached to a tweet.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Activity is the basic building block in Android.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Together with intents, different Android apps can work seamlessly with each other, making the system very

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
powerful and extensible.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
With that, let's get set up to write our first Android app.
