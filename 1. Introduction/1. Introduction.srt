Hello, this is Chiu-Ki Chan, and welcome to Start Developing for Android, the Introduction module.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In this course, I'm going to explain to you how Android works, how to install Android Studio, how to write

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
your very first Android app, and what are the next steps to become an Android developer.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Before we write any code, I will give you a basic understanding of the Android world, what is an Android app,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and how is it organized? How do different components talk to each other?

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Next we will download Android Studio, the Integrated Development Environment, or IDE for Android.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
After we set up Android Studio, we will write our very first Android App, Hello World.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We will start with the bare minimum with activity, layout, strings, and manifest.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
From there, we will add one concept at a time, learning about drawables, dimens, styles, and menu.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
By the end of the course, you will have written your very first Android app and ready to learn more.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will show you different topics to deepen your knowledge, and you'll be on your way to write awesome Android apps.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's get started.
